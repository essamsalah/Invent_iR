Hi Essam
 
Hope you’re doing well.
 
After using the template for a while, the analysts are experiencing a problem with the size of charts. They think the height of them is too short to fit in all the information they want to fit in.
 
I have attached examples of the new height in a word document, it should allow you to just copy and paste but I also have guides as to the size, how they should be centered in the cells, and how they can’t touch the lines of the table they are in.
 
I’ve also attached a picture of the header of the reports, which should have two spaces after.
 
Could we make these change if possible?
 
Thanks!
